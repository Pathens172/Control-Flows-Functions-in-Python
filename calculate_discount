# Step 1: Define the function
def calculate_discount(price, discount_percent):
    if discount_percent >= 20:  # Check if the discount is 20% or more
        discount_amount = price * (discount_percent / 100)  # Calculate the discount
        return price - discount_amount  # Subtract the discount from the price
    else:
        return price  # Return the original price if discount is less than 20%

# Step 2: Prompt user for inputs
price = float(input("Enter the original price of the item: "))
discount_percent = float(input("Enter the discount percentage: "))

# Step 3: Calculate the final price using the function
final_price = calculate_discount(price, discount_percent)

# Step 4: Print the result
if final_price < price:  # If a discount was applied
    print(f"The final price after applying the discount is: ${final_price:.2f}")
else:  # No discount applied
    print(f"No discount applied. The original price is: ${price:.2f}")
